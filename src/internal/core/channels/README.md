# Introduction

This is an idiomatic, minimally-opinionated `Channel` type for JavaScript that's
inspired by [Go's channels](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Channel_types). It
works in browsers and in Node.js. If you know how to use an `Array` then you
already know most of how to use a `Channel`.

## Why

Go's use of channels for concurrency is amazing and with JavaScript's
async/await feature we have the basis for it as well. All that's missing is a
solid `Channel` type. There are existing libraries but I wanted an idiomatic
`Channel` type that's simple and minimally-opinionated.

This document assumes you're familiar with Go's channels and why you'd want to
use them. For explanatory background, see my [blog
article](https://www.nodeguy.com/channels-for-javascript/) on the subject.

## Basic Use

Create a channel with `Channel()`.

To send a value to a channel use `push`. To receive a value from a channel use
`shift`. Always precede the method calls with `await`. Close the channel when
there are no more values to push.

```JavaScript
const assert = require(`assert`);
const Channel = require(`@nodeguy/channel`);

const channel = Channel();

const send = async () => {
  await channel.push(42);
  await channel.close();
};

const receive = async () => {
  assert.equal(await channel.shift(), 42);
  assert.equal(await channel.shift(), undefined);
};

await Promise.all([send(), receive()]);
```

The `push` and `shift` methods are usually called in different async functions.
They represent the two different ends of the channel and act to synchronize the
behavior of the async functions.

# API

The API is in the [API.md](API.md) file.
